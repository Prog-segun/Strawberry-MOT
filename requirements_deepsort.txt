# Requirements for the main tracking environment (ByteTrack, SORT, etc.)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Note: For best results on Windows (to avoid MKL errors), it is
# recommended to create the environment and install the core
# scientific packages with Conda first, then pip install the rest.
